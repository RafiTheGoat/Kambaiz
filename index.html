				 <p> I am a political economist specializing in institutions and economic development, the political economy of development, economic resource allocation, and challenges to state building. I hold an MA in International Political Economy from King’s College London and a PhD in Development Policy from University College London. My academic journey includes serving as an Honorary Visiting Fellow at Durham University’s School of Government and International Affairs (SGIA), where I previously worked as a Teaching Fellow in Comparative Politics of Development during the 2023-2024 academic year. Prior to this, I was an Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Postdoctoral Research Fellow at SOAS, University of London.
<br><br>
Beyond academia, I have contributed to policy and practice as an International Consultant for UNESCO, where I participated in four pilot studies. My research focuses on the intersection of economics, politics, and post-conflict reconstruction. A recent paper examines fiscal policy and economic management in postwar state building, while my 2022 book analyzes Afghanistan’s economic reconstruction under international intervention through an institutionalist framework, with particular attention to private-sector resource allocation in manufacturing. My broader research agenda explores the political economy of post-conflict state building, the role of international financial institutions in fragile environments, the discourse of development policy, and labor dynamics in emerging capitalist economies.
<br><br>
At Durham University, I taught and led seminars across several modules during the 2023-2024 academic year, while also supervising seven undergraduate dissertations. </p>
