            <h3>The Taliban is not playing straight with the west over easing of sanctions</h3>
			<p>April 14, 2023</p>
            <p>The economic and political isolation of Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover in August 2021 has worsened a humanitarian crisis in the country. The World Food Program has projected that between November 2022 and March 2023 the number of food-insecure Afghans would rise to 20 million — 3.2 million of them under the age of five. Some 6 million people were classed in urgent need of assistance....</p>

            <p>November 30, 2021</p>
			<p>In late August 2021, the US completed its withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, ending a 20-year occupation. The Taliban retook the country with shocking speed. The Islamic fundamentalist political group was founded in 1994 and controlled most of Afghanistan until the US-led campaign ousted it in 2001. Now it faces the challenge of forming a new government....</p>

            <p>septembre 21, 2021</p>
			<p>Afghanistan has been nicknamed the “graveyard of empires” in reference to the failure of colonial attempts to govern it. Yet this often distracts from the sombre fact that anyone — whether insiders or outsiders — who has tried to establish control over the whole country has met with resistance. The speed at which the....</p>
